title: Why is a public inquiry needed?
excerpt: On 26 June 2019 the Council of Europe gave Malta three months to start a public inquiry that will uncover the whole truth behind the car bomb assassination of Daphne Caruana Galizia.

<h1>Daphne Caruana Galizia</h1>

<p>Daphne Caruana Galizia, the investigative journalist, writer and anti-corruption activist, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2018/apr/17/journalism-was-her-life-daphne-caruana-galizias-family-speak-out-video" title="'Journalism was her life': Daphne Caruana Galizia's family speak out - video">was murdered on 16 October 2017</a>, in a brutal, intricate assassination. Malta’s most famous journalist, Daphne was murdered close to her home in Bidnija, Malta with a bomb placed under the seat of her car.</p>

<p>Daphne has been <a href="https://timesofmalta.com/articles/view/2018-astor-award-awarded-to-daphne-caruana-galizia.676704" title="2018 Astor Award awarded to Daphne Caruana Galizia">described</a> as “Malta’s crusading scourge of official corruption, cronyism and incompetence… the embodiment of investigative journalism: forthright, uncompromising and totally fearless.”</p>

<p>Within days of Daphne's death, four United Nations experts <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=22262&LangID=E" title="Malta must bring killers of Daphne Caruana Galizia to justice and protect journalists – UN experts">issued a statement</a>, calling on the Government of Malta to “honour its commitment to a prompt, independent investigation”.</p>

<p><mark>It is now over 20 months since Daphne's assassination</mark> and since the call by the UN experts for a “prompt, thorough and independent public inquiry and investigation.” During this time, grave concerns have been raised by numerous international bodies, including the <a href="https://assembly.coe.int/nw/xml/XRef/Xref-XML2HTML-EN.asp?fileid=28053&lang=en" title="PACE - Resolution 2293 (2019) - Daphne Caruana Galizia’s assassination and the rule of law in Malta and beyond: ensuring that the whole truth emerges">Council of Europe</a> and the <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/TA-8-2019-0328_EN.html" title="Texts adopted - Situation of rule of law and fight against corruption in the EU, specifically in Malta and Slovakia  - Thursday, 28 March 2019">European Parliament</a>, regarding the progress and remit of the investigations underway, and the rule of law in Malta.</p>

<h1>Why is a public inquiry needed?</h1>

<p>Following her murder on 16 October 2017, the Maltese authorities initiated criminal proceedings against the men who allegedly detonated the bomb that killed Daphne and a parallel magisterial inquiry into whether others should be charged with criminal offences for commissioning the alleged assassins. Both the criminal proceedings and magisterial inquiry focus solely on criminal culpability.</p>

<p>However, neither process is investigating the wider and even more serious question as to whether the Maltese state is responsible for the circumstances that led to Daphne’s death.</p>

<p>Malta is legally obliged, under <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_2_of_the_European_Convention_on_Human_Rights">Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights</a>, to ensure that the investigation into Daphne's death is <em>independent and effective</em>. This is especially so if there is a possibility of state culpability for the death or system failure in preventing it.</p>

<p>To comply with Malta's Article 2 obligation, Malta's authorities must answer not only the question of who detonated the car bomb, but also wider questions, including questions about criminal culpability of any masterminds behind the assassination and their intermediaries, <mark>what steps were or ought to have been taken by authorities</mark> to protect Daphne and us, her family, from known risks to her life, and any contributing system failures that could or should have been prevented.</p>

<p>In almost two years since the car bomb attack, Malta has still not instituted any form of inquiry into these wider circumstances surrounding Daphne's assassination. As more time passes, more evidence disappears.</p>

		<h2>Why is a public inquiry important?</h2>
	</a>

	<div class="expandable-body">
		<p>Independent and effective examinations of possible breaches or failures by the state to protect the right to life are important to both the victims' families and to everyone else. This is because these examinations are the only legal mechanisms by which the Maltese state can learn lessons about its systemic and institutional cavities and failures, and about the changes it must make to prevent future deaths of investigative journalists and campaigners.</p>

		<h2>How will the public inquiry work?</h2>

	<div class="expandable-body">
		<p>To comply with Article 2 of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Convention_on_Human_Rights" title="European Convention on Human Rights">ECHR</a>, the public inquiry must be conducted independently of state authorities, including the Maltese police, government and politicians.</p>

		<p>It must have comprehensive, transparent and accessible terms of reference. Civil society should be allowed to monitor the public inquiry.</p>

		<p>It must involve us in a meaningful way. This includes access to information and an opportunity to put questions to witnesses. There should be a public hearing stage.</p>
		
		<p>These are the minimum requirements to comply with the law, including by engendering public confidence in the process and allaying public concern.</p>

	</a>

	<div class="expandable-body">
		<p><mark>Currently, there is no legally compliant process examining whether Malta complied with its protective obligation to Daphne.</mark> A public inquiry can determine whether Malta knew, or ought to have known, of a real and immediate risk to Daphne's life; the adequacy of any steps taken by Malta to guard against that risk; and any steps that Malta needs to take to prevent future deaths of investigative journalists or campaigners in similar circumstances.</p>

		<p>The three men arraigned on 4 December 2017 and accused of placing and remotely detonating the bomb which killed Daphne have not been brought to trial.</p>

		<p>The arraignment of the alleged assassins and the “inquiry” in relation to any mastermind, are focused purely on criminal culpability. There is no process investigating the circumstances of Daphne's murder.</p>

		<!-- From: http://burlo.squarespace.com/?offset=1509967177382 -->

		<p>Neither the police nor the magistrate conducting the inquest are tasked or equipped to explore the wider questions surrounding Malta's obligation to protect Daphne. Even if the police investigation and magisterial inquest were operating entirely independently and effectively, they have limited scope and are not tasked with investigating the wider circumstances surrounding Daphne's assassination.</p>

		<p><mark>This includes the crucial question of whether Daphne's life could and should have been saved.</mark> Worse still, the current processes are also inherently unable to perform another key function: that of preventing future deaths.</p>

	<div class="expandable-body">
		<p>There is a potential mechanism within Maltese domestic law which could be used to meet these Article 2 requirements, namely an enhanced version of an inquiry under the <a href="http://www.justiceservices.gov.mt/DownloadDocument.aspx?app=lom&itemid=8763&l=1">Inquiries Act</a>, with terms of reference which mandate Article 2 compliance.</p>

		<p>As a signatory to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Convention_on_Human_Rights">European Convention on Human Rights</a>, it is concerning that Malta's government has not taken urgent action to put in place such an inquiry. On the contrary, Malta's government rejected a proposal for <a href="https://timesofmalta.com/articles/view/government-amendments-dismiss-chris-said-call-for-inquiry.666075">a far more limited inquiry</a>.</p>
